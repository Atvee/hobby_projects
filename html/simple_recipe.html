    <h1>Recipe for a kerala style poratta and beef</h1>
    <p>Kerala-Style Parotta and Beef Fry is a beloved South Indian dish known for its rich, bold flavors and irresistible textures. The flaky, layered parotta is pan-fried to golden perfection, serving as the ideal base to soak up the spicy, slow-roasted beef fry. The beef is typically marinated with a blend of earthy spices, cooked until tender, and then stir-fried with curry leaves, coconut slivers, and caramelized onions, creating a deeply aromatic and savory profile that defines Kerala’s culinary tradition.</p>
